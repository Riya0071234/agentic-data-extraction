A Hierarchical Agentic approach for high-fidelity structured data extraction from complex, unstructured documents.

The **Hierarchical Agentic Schema-Task Decomposition (HASTD)** framework represents a paradigm shift from monolithic prompting to a structured, resilient, and scalable agentic architecture for data extraction. It excels where traditional LLM pipelines fail, especially with large documents and complex JSON schemas.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **‚öôÔ∏è Schema-to-DAG Engine:** Programmatically converts complex JSON schemas into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of discrete, manageable extraction tasks.
* **ü§ñ Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS):** Employs a team of specialized AI agents‚Äîa high-level Orchestrator, fine-tuned Extractor SLMs, and dedicated Validation/Correction agents‚Äîto execute the task graph efficiently.
* **üîÑ Resilient Self-Correction Loop:** Uses LangGraph to create a stateful, cyclical workflow that programmatically validates every extracted piece of data and automatically attempts to correct errors.
* **üéØ Heterogeneous Model Strategy:** Leverages powerful frontier models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus) for complex reasoning and cost-effective, fine-tuned Small Language Models (e.g., Llama 3 8B) for high-throughput extraction.
* **üìà Calibrated Confidence Scoring:** Generates a reliable, multi-faceted confidence score for each field, enabling dependable downstream automation and efficient human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the HASTD framework on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* An OpenAI or Anthropic API key

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hastd-extraction.git](https://github.com/your-username/hastd-extraction.git)
    cd hastd-extraction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the `.env` file and add your API keys:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
        LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..." # For LangSmith tracing
        ```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start: Usage

The HASTD framework can be run as a library or through its FastAPI server.

### As a Library

Import the `HASTDExtractor` class, initialize it, and call the `.extract()` method.

```python
from hastd import HASTDExtractor
import json

# 1. Initialize the extractor
extractor = HASTDExtractor()

# 2. Define your inputs
with open("data/samples/document_1.txt", "r") as f:
    unstructured_text = f.read()

with open("data/samples/schema_1.json", "r") as f:
    json_schema = json.load(f)

# 3. Run the extraction process
result = extractor.extract(
    document_content=unstructured_text,
    json_schema=json_schema
)

# 4. Print the results
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
Certainly. Here is the complete code for your README.md file in a single snippet.

Bash

uvicorn api.main:app --reload
Send a POST request to the /extract endpoint using a tool like curl or Postman.

Bash

curl -X POST [http://120.0.1:8000/extract](http://120.0.1:8000/extract) \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "document_text": "The invoice is for \$500, due on Dec 25, 2025. The vendor is Acme Corp.",
    "json_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "vendor_name": {"type": "string"},
            "total_amount": {"type": "number"},
            "due_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}
        }
